The 20th century started of with the production of the motorised double-deckered buses in London.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the 1960s, bullet trains in Japans and Diesel Engines in the US were introduced. By the first decade of the 21st century, battery operated buses were in operation in China. In the future, the public transport is expected to turn towards more efficient, sustainable and environmental-friendly means.</p>
